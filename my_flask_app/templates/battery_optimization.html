  <h3>Intro & Motivation</h3>
  <p class="opening-paragraph">My goal with this exercise was to deepen my understanding and refine my skills in simulating and optimizing battery energy storage systems. Particularly, I wanted to explore the PuLP python package and use it to develop a robust mixed integer linear program. My objective was to create a simulation for a battery energy storage system that is working behind-the-meter with a building load and responds to grid dynamic pricing over a 24 hour period. In this, I hope to demonstrate my understanding of mixed integer linear programs and the basic physics and engineering principles related to energy systems.

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p class="opening-paragraph">Linear programming is a mathematical method used to find the best possible outcome, like the maximum profit or the lowest cost, for systems whos requirements are represented by linear relationships. In this case, I am minimizing the cost of energy for a building across a 24 hour period. When some of the variables are not continuous, but rather are binary, it adds a layer of complexity to the model known as mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The PuLP python package allows us to model these binary constraints, which make the problem non-convex and also potentially significantly more challenging to solve computationally. 

  <p class="opening-paragraph">In the world of energy storage, MILP becomes particularly powerful, because energy systems operate in a world that has both continuous variables like facility load and also binary variables like the decision to charge or discharge the battery at a given point in time. Typically, these behind-the-meter battery systems have to optimize based on energy prices, demand charges, and load requirements, and MILP allows us to simulate these systems in a way that mirrors real-life decisions.
