    <h3>Intro & Motivation</h3>
    <p class="opening-paragraph">
    My goal with this exercise was to work on my time-series forecasting skills. Particularly, I wanted to see if I could develop both a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and a Random Forest (RF) model to predict the load value on the grid at a particular point in time. </p>

    <p class="opening-paragraph">
    The data I had included the actual load value as well as the Spanish Transmission System Operator (TSO) best-in-class forecasted values. My objective was to compare both my KNN and my RF model against actual and the benchmarked TSO forecasts.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p class="opening-paragraph">
    When it comes to time-series forecasting in the energy space, models like KNN, RF, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), Prophet, Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and XGBoost are common. However, KNN and RF are simpler and more lightweight than these other models, and thus a good place to start. </p>

    <p class="opening-paragraph">KNN is a highly adaptable, lightweight model which adapts swiftly to new data patterns. RF on the other hand can be great for handling multiple features and also can give us a sense of the feature importance. When using a RF model, we can pinpoint the critical drivers of the energy load by using the feature importance output, and this can be a helpful tool in itself. </p>

    <h3>Data Used</h3> 
    <p class="opening-paragraph">
      Data generally from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather/data">this Kaggle project</a>.</p>

      <p class="opening-paragraph">
      This dataset contains 4 years of electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain. Consumption and generation data was retrieved from ENTSOE - a public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) data. Settlement prices were obtained from the Spanish TSO Red Electric Espa√±a. Weather data was purchased as part of a personal project from the Open Weather API for the 5 largest cities in Spain and made public.</p>
