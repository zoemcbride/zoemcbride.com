        Welcome! My name is Zoë McBride. I am a <b>clean energy</b> nerd based in California: at Geli, where I recently worked, I analyzed and optimized <b>energy storage solutions</b> for projects globally; and at UC Berkeley, where I went to school, I studied energy systems as they interact with <b>the built environment and the transportation sector</b>. I have also studied water systems -- at my prior employer, Thornton Tomasetti, I spent several years developing a <b>water balance calculator</b>, a web-based platform for determining a building's water demands and potential water supplies early on in the design phase, way before construction even begins. Throughout my career, I have been motivated to put my analytical, engineering mindset to work addressing the <b>climate change crisis</b> by targeting the energy grid and built environment.</p>

      <p class="opening-paragraph">
        Most recently, I decided to take a hiatus from traditional work to go <b>explore the world</b> and <b>travel throughout Asia</b>. In my travels, my partner and I:
        <br>&emsp;- summitted Thorong La Pass (17,769') in the Nepal Himalayas and Mount Fuji (12,338') in Japan; 
        <br>&emsp;- learned to cook Balinese cuisine; 
        <br>&emsp;- went to the top of urban skyscrapers Petronas Towers, Marina Bay Sands, and Taipei 101; 
        <br>&emsp;- ran in seven countries; 
        <br>&emsp;- navigated our way around numerous impressive public transit systems; 
        <br>&emsp;- snorkeled with manta rays and turtles; 
        <br>&emsp;- kayaked during sunset; 
        <br>&emsp;- visited countless temples; 
        <br>&emsp;- ate absolutely delicious meals; 
        <br>&emsp;- and walked way more than the prerequisite 10,000 steps per day. 
        <br>This experience has been very rewarding and I feel grateful to have been able to learn about different cultures, pick up a few words of new languages, and have a change of perspective from my typical day-to-day life in California. </p>

      <p class="opening-paragraph">
        Throughout my life, outside of work, I have balanced my time between <b>going for runs</b> and <b>playing my violin</b>.  I spent many hours running with Laura Norris Running and the San Francisco Run Club.  Additionally, I have dabbled in violin with musicians at the UCSF Strings Collaborative as well as Awesöme Orchestra.  In 2014, I toured across Europe with the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra.
