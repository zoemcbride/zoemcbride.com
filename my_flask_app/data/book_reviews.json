        "review_text": "I'm not one to pick up autobiographies or biographies very often, but McCurdy really lays it all out there in such a vulnerable and open way with this one that it's hard to walk away not feeling like you've learned something through her story. She does a fabulous job evolving the writing style as she ages throughout the book."
