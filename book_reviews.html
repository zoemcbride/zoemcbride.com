          <h3>Carrie Soto Is Back</h3>
          <p><strong>Author:</strong> Taylor Jenkins Reid</p>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4 / 5</p>
          <p>Having never really played tennis, I was not sure if I&#39;d relate to this story but I&#39;ve always been a fan of TJR so I thought I&#39;d pick it up. Despite that the book revolves around tennis, I could relate to the protagonist&#39;s desire for athleticism and her determination. Her conquest to triumph as she ages is inspiring and she is a strong heroine. If anything, now I feel inspired to learn more about tennis and give it a try. Was a fun read!</p>

          <p><strong>Author:</strong> Jennette McCurdy</p>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4 / 5</p>
          <p>I&#39;m not one to pick up autobiographies or biographies very often, but McCurdy really lays it all out there in such a vulnerable and open way with this one that it&#39;s hard to walk away not feeling like you&#39;ve learned something through her story. She does a fabulous job evolving the writing style as she ages throughout the book.</p>

          <p><strong>Author:</strong> Stacy Willingham</p>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5 / 5</p>
          <p>A captivating murder-mystery novel. Inadvertently devoured the book in five days! The characters are interesting and have a good amount of backstory to feel like you understand them. At certain thrilling moments, I could quite literally feel my heart beat rising. Overall, really enjoyed, and looking forward to reading more from this author!</p>

          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3 / 5</p>
          <p>Really interesting plot, though occasionally a bit confusing to keep up with. I really enjoyed that the author made a point to incorporate many historical details - obviously relating to WW2 but also relating to post-war Paris and the Maison de Dior. Was a fun read! </p>

          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4 / 5</p>
          <p>Read this book in less than a week -- quite an easy read and the mystery element keeps you engaged. Being a Californian, I loved the California backdrop and could picture many of the scenes so well in my mind. The story is compelling and it was a fun read.</p>

          <p>This book was certainly different. Has some interesting points around wealth, art, drugs, and what it means to rest. Disturbing and dark.</p>

          <p>A strange yet enticing book. Thought provoking and enjoyable read, if at times a little disorienting and sad. Be warned, some scenes were incredibly intense and upsetting.</p>

          <p>I learned a lot from this book and found it to be a deeply emotional story about gender and parenthood. I was captivated till the very end. The characters were not always perfect, but it made the story feel all the more real.</p>

          <p><strong>Author:</strong> Christopher McDougall</p>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2 / 5</p>
          <p>As a runner, I thought I would love this book. It definitely inspired me to go run more, and I was convinced by the overarching argument that humans are indeed born to run. However, some of the facts presented are shaky and inconsistent with modern science. I thought it leaned more on story-telling than on facts. Once you can recognize this, it becomes a fun and inspiring read.</p>

          <p>Quirky, imaginative book about all the different life choices that we have as humans on this earth. Left me thinking about the ripple effects of small, sometimes seemingly innocuous, decisions.</p>

          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5 / 5</p>
          <p>This was such a fun read! This book feels like a romance, with breakpoints established for each of Evelyn&#39;s seven husbands, but it has so much more life to it than just that. This is the life story of a woman, who, though fictional, feels very real. Thoroughly enjoyed this!</p>

          <h3>Anxious People</h3>
          <p><strong>Author:</strong> Fredrik Backman</p>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5 / 5</p>
          <p>Frederik Blackman did it again with another great book! I love this author. This story is not quite what you expect at the surface, but promises to provide witty insights on people in peculiar situations. It is a quick and delightful read.</p>
